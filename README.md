# dotfiles
## My personal dotfiles repository

### .vimrc

- Everyone needs line numbers.
- I like to use tabs as a convenience, but prefer 3 spaces. Make "tab" mean "3 spaces"

### .bashrc

- Take a trip to the ocean every time you open your terminal!
- Useful PS1

### ssh-config

- Make it easy to ssh into CAEN. If you use this ssh-config file, be sure to update "#yourUserName" to be your uniqname. Then ssh into CAEN by saying "ssh caen" instead of "ssh yourUserName@login.engin.umich.edu".
