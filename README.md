### .vimrc

1. Everyone needs line numbers.
2. I like to use tabs as a convenience, however, tabs don't always translate into the same number of spaces when other people open your code in their editors. Keep it consistent by making "tab" mean "3 spaces please!"

### .bashrc

1. macOS has "gcc" aliased as "Clang" -- fight back (you'll need to modify this to point to your gcc installation)
2. Take a trip to the ocean every time you open your terminal!
3. Simple, useful PS1.

### ssh-config

1. Make it easy to ssh into CAEN. If you use this ssh-config file, be sure to update "#yourUserName" to be your uniqname. Then ssh into CAEN by saying "ssh caen" instead of "ssh yourUserName@login.engin.umich.edu".
